# Pokemon Fusion Line Checker (Finish the Line Edition!)
Used to create the data in the [Finish the Line Auto-Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l5odSUYcGQKZG19BF_m-uqtCOtat7Sm-CHzhGtNffh8/edit?usp=sharing).

Original version/code is from SylviBlossom. This was forked from their directory--massive kudos to them!
---
My changes were focused on...
- Updating it to include all Pokemon currently in IF,
- Bug-fixing,
- And improving the overall utility
---
Run 'gen.py' to easily check fused evolution lines, or to re-export the CSV sheets.

Added Bonus:
You can also run 'attributeexporter.py' to generate, filter, and export lists of Pokemon based on criteria from 'pokemon.txt'
