# Pokemon Fusion Line Checker (Finish the Line Edition!)
Used to create the data in the [Finish the Line Auto-Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l5odSUYcGQKZG19BF_m-uqtCOtat7Sm-CHzhGtNffh8/edit?usp=sharing).

Original version/code is from SylviBlossom. This was forked from their directory--massive kudos to them!

My changes were focused on...
- Updating it to include all Pokemon currently in IF,
- Removing the broken sprite-links since it seems like wherever they were being taken from no longer exists,
- And then noticing that Pokemon evolving at the same level weren't being accounted for properly and spending the next millenia trying to fix it,
- Plus fixing some smaller issues I happened across while trying to figure that out.

Run `gen.py` in the command line to easily check fused evolution lines, or to re-export the CSV sheets.
