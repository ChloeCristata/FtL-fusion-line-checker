# Pokemon Fusion Line Checker (Finish the Line Edition!)
Used to create the data in the [Finish the Line Auto-Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l5odSUYcGQKZG19BF_m-uqtCOtat7Sm-CHzhGtNffh8/edit?usp=sharing).

Original version/code is from SylviBlossom. Massive kudos to them!


Run `gen.py` in the command line to easily check fused evolution lines, or to re-export the CSV sheets.
